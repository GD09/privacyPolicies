            <p>Welcome to Period bear! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Our application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile operating system, and information about the way you use the application.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Permissions Used</h2>
            <p>Our application requests the following permissions to function properly:</p>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>Camera (CAMERA)</h3>
                <p>This permission allows the app to access your device's camera to capture photos or videos. We use this feature to [explain why your app needs camera access, e.g., "allow you to take and upload profile pictures or scan QR codes"]. We do not store or share your camera data without your explicit permission.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>Precise Location (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)</h3>
                <p>This permission allows the app to access your precise location using GPS and network-based location. We use this information to [explain the purpose, e.g., "show nearby points of interest, provide location-based services, or improve our services"]. Your location data is only used when the app is in use and is not stored on our servers unless you choose to share it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>Approximate Location (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</h3>
                <p>This permission allows the app to access your approximate location using network-based location. This is used to [explain the purpose, e.g., "provide location-based services with less precision than GPS"]. This helps us provide relevant content while using less battery power than precise location services.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>Notifications (NOTIFICATIONS)</h3>
                <p>This permission allows the app to send you notifications. We use this to [explain the purpose, e.g., "keep you updated with important information, alerts, or promotional content"]. You can manage your notification preferences in your device settings at any time.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>Internet (INTERNET)</h3>
                <p>This permission allows the app to access the internet to send and receive data. This is essential for the app's core functionality, including [explain the purpose, e.g., "loading content, syncing data, and providing real-time updates"].</p>
            </div>

            <div class="permission">
                <h3>View Network Connections (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE)</h3>
                <p>This permission allows the app to view information about network connections such as which networks exist and are connected. We use this to [explain the purpose, e.g., "optimize data usage, handle offline functionality, and ensure smooth app performance"].</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
